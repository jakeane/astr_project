### Description
JJTRealtors is a realtor website for a colonized living quarters on Mars. Our website includes information on pod floor plans, sightseeing, amenities, and life on mars while also providing users the opportunity to book a tour (subsequently booking a flight to mars) and applying to JJTRealtors.  The website includes static information about Mars as well as up-to-date information that is pulled from NASA’s API’s in real time. Science concepts we are looking to include are information about the composition of Mars and its atmosphere, climate data, analysis of minerals and existence of water, history of geologic activity, and current news on spaceflight and lander technology regarding Mars. The immersive and comprehensive experience is created through the learnings of course material and NASA’s public information.
